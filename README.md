# 3 Glasses Problem A,B,C
There are 3 totally similar glasses and a robot/machine. They are decided by people which of them are A, B, or C. Robot/Machine does not know which of them is A, B, or C.

The robot/machine is requested to order them as the user want.
For example, a user wants glasses stacked as C, A, and B.
There are loops as entered by the user. For example, the robot/machine tries to order the glasses as randomly 100 times.
Then statistics are calculated about how much of them are stacked as requested.
